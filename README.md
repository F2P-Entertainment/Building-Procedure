# Building Procedure

We encourge you to follow this general guide when building in Roblox Studio.
This guide's purpose is to create the best practices and workflow for all team members to work together with ease.

## General:
- Anything that a Script requires access to should be easy to find within the **[Explorer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210189-13bfee00-7ec3-11eb-95ef-3e2c6d74804f.png)**
- [Disable Shift lock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210274-75805800-7ec3-11eb-8328-355c477006d8.png)
- Never allow players to zoom out and see behind a map, breaking their immersion
- **Never Use Terrain**

## Naming Conventions:
- Never use abbverations, names should always be [Verbose](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/verbose)
- Names must not include special characters. ie "Left Door" should be named as "LeftDoor"
## Scriptables:
- Model must have a [PrimaryPart called "Root"](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210457-64841680-7ec4-11eb-9717-7fa827c12672.png)
- Model's PrimaryPart must be facing Forward [as you can see the Hinge](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210567-d0667f00-7ec4-11eb-8397-1794ebc6a46d.png) is pointing Forward

## Organization:
Rule of thumb: If you can't find a specific asset within 10 seconds in Explorer you have a problem
- Group assets and parts together in folders. Attempt to group them at the smallest,
yet reasonable level possible (A folder for a room is good. An individual folder for
every part in a room is not).

Below is an example of the map shown (
+ Environment (Entire Map, organized based on location)
  + Areas: Divide the map into large areas. For instance, the above map can be divided to Hill, Left Slope, Right Slope, Central Pool, Rock Path. 
    + Subarea: Add if applicable. Used for dividing significant features within an area. For instance, the “houses” should be separated out from “Right Slope”
      + Specific Area: Used for further separating smaller group units. Use numbers where appropriate. For instance, each house will have their own “House” folder,         such as “House1”
          - Specific Thing: Used as the group for parts. Use numbers where appropriate. For instance, parts for a bookcase will be put under “bookcase1”
+ Scriptable (Gameplay, organized based on features):
  + Features: Divide the map’s features that use scripts into different groups. For instance, Teleporters, Doors,etc.
    + Feature Areas: Add if applicable. Used to divide similar features that appear through the map into areas of significance. For instance, the “Doors” will be          divided into “Left Slope”
      - Specific features: Used for further dividing scripted features into individualized groups. For instance, “House 1, 2, 3”


- In general, group interior builds (ex. inside a house, spaceship) according to rooms;
group exterior builds (islands, villages, parks) according to distinctive areas of the
map.
- [Example 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210612-0441a480-7ec5-11eb-8c1f-a50b214e61c0.png), [Example 2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210677-54b90200-7ec5-11eb-953e-b153858aa4e3.png)

## Automation:

## Colors and Lighting:
**Building style: Low poly, cartoony, saturated bright and cheerful**
- In 99% of cases, use [smooth plastic material](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210876-52a37300-7ec6-11eb-8d4c-c71deff6d7c9.png)
- Disable [Part.CastShadow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210856-30115a00-7ec6-11eb-90fa-7f42d295165e.png) (unless explicitly appropriate)
- Always use [Voxel technology](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110210800-f04a7280-7ec5-11eb-9345-1157b0dc5ee3.png) for lighting (unless stated otherwise)
- Never let lighting/lack of lighting affect the dynamicism of parts

## Do's:
- Always use high ceilings (high enough that players’ head cannot really collide it when
jumping). Exceptions given to areas designed to be small, such as air vents or tiny
tunnels.
- Always use [Snap To Grid](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55673217/110211019-250af980-7ec7-11eb-9255-72edd8d8f1f2.png)

## Don't s:
- Never build whole maps in [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). Small 3D assets are fine.
- [Nerver allow Z-Fighting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-fighting)
- Nerver allow walls, ceilings, and floors to be thinner than 2 studs
- Nerver allow players’ head to clip into walls, ceilings, floors, or objects
- Nerver allow gaps in Builds
